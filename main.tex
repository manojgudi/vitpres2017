% Slide 2
\begin{frame}{Motivation..}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Estimation: \textit{a rough calculation of the value, number, quantity, or extent of something.}
  \item Humans estimate all the time
  \item Useful and practical estimations:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Movement of cyclones while weather forecasting
    \item Value of a stock in equity market
    \item Predicting and correcting flight path by it's position
    \item Estimating length of this talk by number of slides
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\vskip 1cm
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Slide 3
\begin{frame}{..Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Each estimation is prone to errors
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Difficult to track cyclone because of complex models
    \item Too much volatility in markets due to external factors
    \item Noisy data from sensors, susceptible to failure
    \item Speaker was a student not too long ago, knows how to hide no. of slides
  \end{itemize}
  \item Metrics of real-life systems are often difficult to measure and noisy
\end{itemize}

% Slide 4
\begin{frame}{Pre-Sandhi}

\begin{itemize}
  \item LabVIEW: A proprietary visual programming software by NI
  \item Vendor lockdown 
  \item Buy NI DAC cards .. Buy LabVIEW  = \textbf{ \textit{Expensive Maxx}}
  \item Little care for support on Free Operating Systems: GNU/Linux.
  \item Initial target: Virtual Labs, IIT Bombay.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Free and Open source
  \item Easy to use | Clean interface | Drag \& Drop 
  \item Should run on GNU/Linux smoothly
  \item Able to carry out control system experiments
  \item Framework should support \textbf{feedbacks}
\end{itemize}

% Slide 6
\section{Sandhi Basic Features}
\begin{frame}{Features}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Light-weight \textasciitilde 20mb without depdendencies
  \item Good Hardware driver support
  \item Language support for Development: Scilab, GNU/Octave, Python, C++
  \item Developed for Control system application
  \item But can be easily extended for
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Image Processing*
	\item Neural Networks*
	\item And any other areas which can be represented as data-flowgraph
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% Slide 7
\begin{frame}{Sandhi \textless3 Scilab}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Sciscipy wrapper - Sylvestre Ledru and Vincent Guffens
  \item Sample code
  \begin{itemize}\item \textit{from scilab import Scilab 
                \\  sci = Scilab()
                \\  x = sci.rand(20, 20)
                \\  y = x*x.transpose()
                \\  y\_inv = sci.inv(y)}
  \end{itemize}
  \item RIP: Linker Bug [2011-13]
  \item Fixed for Scilab 5.4+  YEAH!
  \item Use pure* functions of Scilab directly
  \item Provides way to evaluate code-string too.
\end{itemize}
\vskip 1cm

% Slide 8
\section{Current Development I}
\begin{frame}{Current Approach:Functional Approach}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Referential Transparency (Pure and Impure Functions)
  \item Using GNU Radio's rudimentary type checker
  \item Function composition = \textit{complex becomes simple}
  \item Few impure functions are inherited from GNU Radio
  \item if \textit{(software == reliable)} then \textit{blame(hardware\_guys)}
\end{itemize}
\vskip 1cm
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Slide 9
\section{Current Development II}
\begin{frame}{Exciting features in pipeline}

\begin{itemize}
  \item HaPy Wrapper (David Fischer)integrated and tested (for Pure functions)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Terse and elegant code
    \item Compiled and faster
    \item Immutable objects means easily \textit{parallelizable}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Shifting to cloud based architecture(using RPC)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A client side containing smaller GRC, runtime environment
    \item Server side containing heaviy libraries
    \item Prototyped using RabbitMQ's RPC service(AQMP)
    \item Should work well for heavy simulations (if not realtime app)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Functional block generator
\end{itemize}
